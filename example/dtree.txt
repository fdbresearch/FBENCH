# This file defines a dtree (or variable order) of the query. 
# 
# 1) First line, gives number_of_variables and number_of_relations. 
# 2) The we list each variable in the dtree using the following order:  
# 	id name type parent dtree-key caching-boolean
#
# 	- The id is used to identify this attribute later on, and should be ordered from 0 to number_of_variables-1.
# 	- The parent of the root set to -1.
# 	- The caching-boolean indicates if we can cache at this node in the dtree. 
#
# 3) List each relation_name, with the id of the variable in this relation that is the lowest node in the dtree, and 
#	 the list of variables in this relation.
